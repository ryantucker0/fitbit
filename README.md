Idea to pick a location in the world and walk to it from your current location. So if I'm in Madison and it's X steps to Lake Michigan, I can set X steps as my goal and track my progress. Fun way to see how long it would take to walk to different areas. Eventually I'd like to make the locations customizable but let's start with the basics first.

Idea sparked by: @noopkat
She's using the Fitbit API to track how many times she's walked to the space station and back. I thought this was really cool except I'd like to make my own locations, not just the space station. Check her out on GitHub. She also streams her coding sessions on Twitch which is awesome!
